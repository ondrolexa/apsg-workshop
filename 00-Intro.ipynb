    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is one of the most popular open source languages in history. There are more than 100,000 open source packages published on the official package index [PiPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) alone and many more projects in general. Scientific Python environment is a mature ecosystem of python packages for doing far reaching scientific analysis in python. In this workshop we cover few core packages and show you the door for further study. We will introduce [APSG](https://github.com/ondrolexa/apsg) package to manage, analyze and visualize orientational structural geology data."

    "Python itself must be installed first and then there are many packages to install, and it can be confusing for beginners. If you use Linux or MacOS then you will have a default Python installed and you can use it. For Windows you have to install something. There are several options for setting up a nice Python development environment but the setup that is becoming \"standard\" is *Continuum Analytics* **Anaconda Distribution**, which we will use in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anaconda Distribution** is a free, easy-to-install package manager, environment manager and Python distribution with a collection of 1,000+ open source packages with free community support. Anaconda is platform-agnostic, so you can use it whether you are on Windows, macOS or Linux. You can learn more about Anaconda and conda by reading the [Anaconda Documentation pages](https://docs.anaconda.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Few reasons to use Anaconda:\n",
    " * The people behind it are great Python programmers\n",
    " * It is a very nice collection of the most important Python packages\n",
    " * Package management using conda is excellent\n",
    " * It has some optimized numerical libraries linked with the latest Intel MKL libraries\n",
    " * It is a strong \"ecosystem\" for developers\n",
    " * It is available on Linux, MacOS and Windows\n",
    " * It is an Open Data Science platform\n",
    " * It is also a very good \"R\" platform\n",
    " * It by default installs to your home directory and doesn't interfere with any other Python install you may have.\n",
    " * It is easy to install!\n",
    "\n",
    "Download Anaconda from https://www.continuum.io/downloads. Note the architecture of your computer (32 or 64bits). Both Python 2.x and 3.x options are available, but this lecture series is based on Python 3.x"

Instead, an IPython notebook is stored as a file in the [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format. The advantage is that we can mix formatted text, Python code and code output. It requires the IPython notebook server to run it though, and therefore isn't a stand-alone Python program as described above. Other than that, there is no difference between the Python code that goes into a program file or an IPython notebook."
